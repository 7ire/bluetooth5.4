Bluebugging

Bluebugging is a form of Bluetooth attack where an attacker gains full control over a Bluetooth-enabled device, allowing them to access and modify information, use the device to make calls, send text messages, and even connect to the internet. This is a much more severe and invasive threat than Bluesnarfing and Bluejacking, given the level of control it provides to the attacker.

Executing a Bluebugging attack is similar to Bluesnarfing, beginning with identifying an active, vulnerable Bluetooth device within range. The attacker then exploits vulnerabilities in the Bluetooth implementation of the device, often by tricking the user into believing they are pairing with a trusted device or brute forcing a Bluetooth pairing PIN on an implementation that does not prompt the user for confirmation. Once access is gained, the attacker can essentially control the device as if it were their own.

The impact of Bluebugging can be severe, given the comprehensive control it provides to the attacker. Personal information such as contact details, messages, and emails can be accessed and modified, or the device can be used to make calls or send messages. Additionally, the deviceâ€™s microphone and camera can be remotely operated, turning the device into a covert listening device.

Maintaining device security, keeping devices updated with the latest firmware and security patches, and following recommended security practices to mitigate potential risks associated with Bluebugging and other Bluetooth-related vulnerabilities remains crucial.

# KNOB

"The attacker intercepts the Bluetooth pairing communication and forcibly sets the length of the encryption key to its minimum allowed size, which is only one byte. With such a weak encryption key, it becomes trivial for the attacker to crack it through brute force methods, thereby gaining access to the encrypted communication."

Fix -> Each device shall have maximum and minimum encryption key length parameters which defines the maximum and minimum size of the encryption key allowed in octets. The maximum and minimum encryption key length parameters shall be between 7 octets (56 bits) and 16 octets (128 bits), in 1 octet (8 bit) steps. This is defined by a profile or device application.
